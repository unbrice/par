1/ The parts

The Gateway (located in /Gateway/), is a server hosted on Google App
Engine. It receives directives created by an interface (either the web
interface in /Gwt/ or the command-line interface in /cli/) via HTTP.
When the Gateway receives one message, it wakes the Android device
that should handle it using Google's C2DM. When the device awakes, its
software (located in /AndroidClient/) fetches the directive from the
Gateway, and runs them.

All messages are encoded using ProtocolBuffer, the corresponding
definitions are in the eponym folder (/ProtocolBuffers/).

/JavaCommon/ is a common set of functions used by the Gateway, the
AndroidClient and the CLI (but not by the GWT interface at the time of
writing).

2/ Reliability (DirectiveIdData)

The glue between that allows the different subproject to comunicate
are the ProtocolBuffers and the acknowledgement scheme.

When a user interface is first loaded on a machine, it generates an
ID, which a 64bit number such that the likelihood of generating the
same ID twice for a given user is minimised. It also initializes a
message counter to 0.
Every time a user interface sends a new Directive to the server, it
increases its message counter. Should this counter overflow, the
interface would regenerate a new ID.
The pair of this interface ID and the timestamp forms a DirectiveId.

The Gateway passes the DirectiveId to the AndroidClient as part of the
directive.
The AndroidClient keeps track of the latest timestamp for each
client. When it requests new directives, it also sends the latest
timestamp for all interfaces, thus acknowledging that it received and
applied them, and that they can be deleted on the server.
With the directives, the Gateway provides the AndroidClient with a
list of client_ids that had no queued messages so that the client
knows it can forget their timestamps.
